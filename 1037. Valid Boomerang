/*
LOGIC---
What question is asking to return if all three points can be joined by a single straight line ( i.e we have to return if the given three points are non-collinear)

So if three points are non collinear then they form triangle. So all we need to check if the area of the triangle formed is non-zero. If the area is zero it means all three points are collinear.

Suppose the three points are (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3).
So area of triangle is given by : 0.5 * [x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)]

Thus we just need to check the condition if [x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)] !=0

area of triangle = (1/2) |x1(y2 − y3) + x2(y3 − y1) + x3(y1 − y2)|
