/*
Why hashset?
The equal elements were causing us a problem.
Hashset quickly allow us to access element so it will help us to tell whetehr there is a consecutive elent or not.

Once put everything in hahset.
We start iterating from first element and think to check whether next consecutive exist or not in hahsset. But that sounds just like bruteforce. Checking from every element.

Trick: Instead of looking for next consecutive we try looking whether our curr is the start of a consecutive series or not. So, we look backward till we find the start.

And from there we start looking in front.

So, when we encounter a mid elemnt of a consecutive series, we don't reiterate till we say its start of a consecutive series.
