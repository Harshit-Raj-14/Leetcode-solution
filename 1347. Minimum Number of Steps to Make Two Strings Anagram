/*
LOGIC---
Maintain a count array for s first which will have all chars frequency.
You can subtract all char frequency now using t.
The remaining frequencies whether +ve or -ve are differneces that we need to overcome to make them anagrams.
Since, we have the ability to replace, we can replace an unequal character to another desirable character.
So, the frequency sum of the left count array should be divided by two representing the number of steps.
