If num[i-1] < num[i] > num[i+1], then num[i] is peak
If num[i-1] < num[i] < num[i+1], then num[i+1...n-1] must contains a peak
If num[i-1] > num[i] > num[i+1], then num[0...i-1] must contains a peak
If num[i-1] > num[i] < num[i+1], then both sides have peak


If the array contains only one element, it is easy to see that this element is a peak element.
