select * FROM Users WHERE mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.\_]*@leetcode[\.]com$'



Here's a breakdown of the regex pattern:
^: Asserts the start of the string.
[a-zA-Z]+: Matches one or more alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase).
[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.\_]*: Matches zero or more alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), dots (.), or underscores (_).
@leetcode: Matches the literal string @leetcode.
[\.]com$: Matches the string .com at the end of the email address. The backslash before the dot is used to escape the dot, so it is treated as a literal character rather than a wildcard.


[]: Denotes a character class, which matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.

+: Indicates that the preceding element (the character class [a-zA-Z]) must appear one or more times. So, the email must start with at least one letter.
*: Means that the preceding element (the entire character class) can appear zero or more times. This allows the part before @leetcode.com to be a mix of letters, numbers, dashes, dots, or underscores, or even be empty.
