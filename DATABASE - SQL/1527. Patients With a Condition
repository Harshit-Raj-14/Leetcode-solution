SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%' OR conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%';


SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '\\bDIAB1';


LOGIC---
\b is a regular expression token that represents a word boundary, which means it matches the position where a word starts or ends.
In MySQL, you need to escape the backslash, so \\b is used to correctly denote the word boundary.

The expression conditions REGEXP '\\bDIAB1' is actually the same as conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%' OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%';, but it is obviously shorter. 
The reason they are the same is that \b matches either a non-word character (in our case, a space) or the position before the first character in the string. 
Also, you need to escape a backslash with another backslash, like so: \\b. Otherwise, the regular expression won't evaluate.
P.S. \b also matches the position after the last character, but it doesn't matter in the context of this problem.
