SELECT a.id 
FROM Weather a, Weather b 
WHERE DATEDIFF(a.recordDate, b.recordDate)=1 AND a.temperature>b.temperature;


LOGIC---
First use inner join o make another table so that you can have two list of dates to easily compare today with yesterday.

Intiution---
By doing a self-join(cross join effect) on the Weather table, we create a Cartesian product of the table with itself, creating pairs of days. 
We then use the DATEDIFF function to restrict these pairs to only include consecutive days. 
Lastly, we filter these pairs of consecutive days further to only include pairs where the temperature is higher on the second day. 
The resulting ids represent the days where the temperature was higher than the previous day.

QUERY FLOW---
So, first we creat  a cartesian product kind of thing using join.
Next we find dates that differ with 1 => a.date - b.date = 1  => today-yesterday=1
And in this temp(a)>temp(b) then only print a.id.


/* SQL Server DATEDIFF() Function */
Return the difference between two date values, in years:
SELECT DATEDIFF(year, '2017/08/25', '2011/08/25') AS DateDiff; 

Syntax : DATEDIFF(interval, date1, date2)
interval can be -> year, month, hour,day
