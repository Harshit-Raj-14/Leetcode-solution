/* JAVASCRIPT eval() method SOLUTION */
var calculate = function(s){
    return eval(s);
};

LOGIC---
Use the javascript inbuilt method eval(String)
Return type is number
Note : why you should not use val in real life : eval() executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller. 
If you run eval() with a string that could be affected by a malicious party, you may end up running malicious code on the user's machine with the permissions of your webpage/extension.
