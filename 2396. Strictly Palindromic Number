class Solution {
    public boolean isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
        return false;
    }
}

/*
LOGIC---

I think the solution is indeed always False.... Lets see why this simple hit and trial soultion works. It works because of the mathematics going behind. 

The question says that number N has to be palindromic for every base b from 2 to N-2...

Lets take the case when base b is N-2. Its very clear that if you try to represent N in base N-2, you will always get quotient as 1 and remainder as 2, thus the representation of number N in base N-2 is always (12) which is as can be seen non-palindromic. 

THUS THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM FOR ANY INTEGER N is always False and thats why this one liner works ðŸ˜„
