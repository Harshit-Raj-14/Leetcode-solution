LOGIC---
Plank length=n

Observation : The ants change their way when they meet is equivalent to continue moving without changing their direction.
Hence, answer is the max distance for one ant to reach the end of the plank in the facing direction.

The collision rule doesn't matter at all, the effect is the same as if the ants just phased through each other.

Since the ants will just pass through effect becuase collisona nd turn are immediate.

The real solution lies in the fact, that which ant is the farthest distance from the edge.

Farthes from left moving ants = (maximum of array left) - 0
Farthest from right moving ants = n - (minimum of array right)
