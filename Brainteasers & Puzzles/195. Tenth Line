# Read from the file file.txt and output the tenth line to stdout.
awk 'NR==10' file.txt


###
The command you provided, awk 'NR==10' file.txt, is an AWK command used to extract the 10th line from the file named file.txt. Let's break it down:
awk: AWK is a versatile programming language primarily used for pattern scanning and text processing.

'NR==10': This is the pattern or condition being checked. NR stands for "Number of Records," which is a built-in variable in AWK representing the current line number being processed. 
NR==10 checks if the current line number is equal to 10.

file.txt: This is the input file from which AWK is reading the lines.

So, when you run awk 'NR==10' file.txt, AWK will process file.txt line by line, and when it reaches the 10th line, it will print that line to the standard output. 
If file.txt has fewer than 10 lines, it won't produce any output.
