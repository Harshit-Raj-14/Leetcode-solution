/* O(n) BEATS 100% */
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]<nums[i-1]) return nums[i];
        }
        return nums[0]; //case array rotated n times or not rotated
    }
}

LOGIC -
Since on rotating the array, we will get two monotonous lines on graph, the smallest will be the one with the first occurence of  nums[i-1]>nums[i]<nums[i+1]
Just check where this occurs and return nums[i]
Edge case will be n times rotated, so no equality found returnt the first elemtn becuase array would be compeltely sorted


Another way to see the pivot is that it would be the smallest element in the rotated array,  so you can just search ofr the smallest element
