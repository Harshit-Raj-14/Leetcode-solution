LOGIC---
What we are doing here is fiding total_sum from zero index to last index.
Next we start finding sum from zero index to i.
If sum turns out to be half of (total_sum - nums[i]). then i will be the pivot. Since the both sides of pivot have equal sum.

Don't use => curr==(total-nums[i])/2
USE => 2*curr==(total-nums[i])
REASON : dividing by 2 will lose precision and result in an incorrect check

/*   ACCEPTED O(n) solution by balance scale  */
/* This is the same as above code just with wieghts and an inbuilt function. 
#1.Think of the Balance scale in laboratory or traditional markets.
#2. Imagine each number from input list as a weight.
#3 Turn the finding of pivot index with left hand sum = right hand sum into the procedure of reaching the balance on boths sides.

Algorithm:

Step_#1: Let Left hand side be empty, and Right hand side holds all weights.

Step_#2: Iterate weight_i from 0 to (n-1) During each iteration, take away weight_#i from right hand side, check whether balance is met or not. If yes, then the index i is the pivot index.
If no, put weight_#i on the left hand side, and repeat the process until balance is met or all weights are exchanged.

Step_#3: Finally, if all weights are exchanged and no balance is met, then pivot index does not exist, return -1. */
