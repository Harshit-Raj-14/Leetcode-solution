What then is the "best strategy" for a senator to ban an opponent senator? Click to Reveal.
Using this "best strategy" we will be able to predict the only possible unique winner for a given senate string.
Let's try to analyze. What if we ban the next opponent senator? Are we gaining anything?
The answer intuitively is Yes. When we ban the next closest opponent senator, we are restricting one senator from the other party which they could have used to ban a senator from our party. 
Thus, proceeding with this strategy, we are not only eliminating one opponent senator but also trying to preserve our own senators.
Hence, the "best strategy" for a senator is to ban the next closest opponent senator.
This falls under the category of Greedy, whereby the "best strategy" is greedily chosen at each step in hope of local optimum.

If the number of senators from one party becomes zero, we can return the other party as the winner.
