/*
LOGIC---
Goal - If we have two string a and b and we have to check whether b is rotation of a or not
    
APPROACH---
=> If length of both the string are not equal then it is not possible that they are rotation of each other.
=> We just concatentate string a with itself.
Now just check whether b string present inside a or not. If present then it is true
    else false
