/*
LOGIC---
Transpose -> is reading each row now columnwise
Or, reading each column row-wise

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows with columns. If you have a matrix A with dimensions m x n, the transpose, denoted as A^T, will have dimensions n x m. In other words, if the original matrix has m rows and n columns, the transposed matrix will have n rows and m columns.
