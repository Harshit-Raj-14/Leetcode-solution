LOGIC ---
A simple example explaining why it works: mainTank (M) = 13, additionalTank (A) = 3

M  M  M  M  M   A  M  M  M  M   A   M  M  M  M   A
1 [2  3  4  5]  6 [7  8  9 10]  11 [12 13 14 15] 16

The first liter is outside of the cycle, and then we have a cycle of length 4, i.e., for every 4 liters from the mainTank we can add 1 liter from the additionalTank.
F(M,A) = 10 * (M + min((M-1)/4, A))
