/*
Itâ€™s impossible if the same number occurs more than twice. So just check the frequency of each value.
Means we would only need elements with frequency 1 or 2.

Why needs distinct2?
eg : [10,10]
output : true
You cna put one 10 in one array and other in another
All you need to know that if there is a distinct2 element present you can still make two arrays splitting possible.
