/*
LOGIC---

Given: R->right; L->left; S->stationary
two moving cars collide -> collision=2
one moving car collide -> collision=1

Imagine all cars on a striaght road like in an array:
So, cases when collison can occur:
Direction::: 
<----L   R---->
Types: LR, RL, LS, SL, RS, SR

RL, SL, RS -> Collide
LR, LS, SR -> no collision

hence by knowing the previous state of the road, we can find whether collison will happen or not.

After each reading we will update the previous road state.

As we move formward we will always need to know of the previous state to decide whether collison will be occuring or not.

Note : edge case
Note as oserver you are travelling left to right.
So, in cases of when: 
SRRRRRL...
occurs you need to take the continuous chain of R as well
imagin it something like this being the state of road:
| -> -> -> -> -> <-
Well, now you see how many collision are going to occur here.
collision = 2 + xR; 
Here x=3
As, RL will become S and you will need to retrack RRRRS scenario.

Same goes for scenario : RRRRS : -> -> -> -> |
Here also you iwll need to consider powerR

You don''t kneed to owrry about LLLLLR type which won't happen.(only 1 collision value=2)
