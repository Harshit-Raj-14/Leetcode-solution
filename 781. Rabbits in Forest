/*
LOGIC---
To get the minimum no of rabbits---
=> the rabbit that tells the same number could be put together in the same category color.
=> but this will be only possible for ans 'x' there can e only x more x. if there are more than x x's, restart
=> study testcase - [2,2,2,2,2], [10,10,10]

eg: [2,2,2,2,2]
first rabbit says 2 => there are 3 rabbits with same color => so two more rabbits can say 2
now 2 more 2's left => 2 more rabbit can say 2
=> 3 rabbits of same color + 3 rabbits of same color = 6

eg: [10,10,10]
first rabbit says 10 => there are 11 rabbits with same color => so 10 more rabbits can say 10


becuase rabbit answers how many other rabbits have same color as his.

EDGE CASE : When a rabbit answers 0 it means they are unique. So, handle it seperately.
